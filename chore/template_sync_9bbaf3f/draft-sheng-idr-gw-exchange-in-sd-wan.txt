1.  Introduction

   [I-D.draft-dmk-rtgwg-multisegment-sdwan] describes the enterprises
   utilizing Cloud Providers’ backbone to interconnect their branch
   offices.  As shown in Figure 1, CPE-1 and CPE-2 are connected to
   their respective Cloud Gateways (GW) in different regions.  CPE-1 and
   CPE-2 maintain the pairwise IPsec SAs.  The IPsec encrypted traffic
   from CPE-1 to CPE-2 is encapsulated by the GENEVE header [RFC8926],
   with the outer destination address being the GW1.
   [I-D.draft-dmk-rtgwg-multisegment-sdwan] specifies a set of sub-TLVs
   to carry the information of the GWs of the destination branches,
   e.g., GW3 for CPE-2 and other attributes.

   To accomplish that, CPE-1 needs to know their peers' corresponding GW
   addresses.  This document proposes a BGP extension based on
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-sdwan-edge-discovery] for a CPE to advertise its
   directly connected GW address to other CPEs.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following acronyms and terms are used in this document:

   *  Cloud DC: Off-Premises Data Center, managed by 3rd party, that
      hosts applications, services, and workload for different
      organizations or tenants.

   *  CPE: Customer (Edge) Premises Equipment.

   *  OnPrem: On Premises data centers and branch offices.

   *  RR Route Reflector.

   *  SD-WAN: Software Defined Wide Area Network.  In this document,
      “SD-WAN” refers to a policy-driven transporting of IP packets over
      multiple underlay networks for better WAN bandwidth management,
      visibility, and control.

   *  VPN Virtual Private Network.

3.  Extension to SD-WAN Underlay UPDATE for Corresponding GWs

   The Client Routes Update is the same as described in Section 5 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-sdwan-edge-discovery].

3.1.  Corresponding GW Sub-TLV

   The Corresponding GW Sub-TLV, within the SD-WAN-Hybrid Tunnel TLV
   (code point 25), carries the corresponding GW address(es) with which
   the SD-WAN edge is associated.

   The following is the structure of the Corresponding GW Sub-TLV:

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   Type=TBD    |    length     |  reserved     |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Corresponding GW Addr Family  | Address                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ (variable)                    +
      ~                                                               ~
      |             Corresponding GW Address                          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
