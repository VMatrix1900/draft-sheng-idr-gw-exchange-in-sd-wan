1.  Introduction

   To interconnect geographically faraway branches or SASE resources,
   multi-segment SD-WAN is often deployed via cloud
   backbone[I-D.draft-dmk-rtgwg-multisegment-sdwan].  As shown in
   Figure 1, CPE 1 and CPE 2 are connected to the nearest Cloud GW in
   different regions.  For the traffic from CPE 1 to CPE 2, the CPE 1
   will encapsulate the address of the egress GW(GW3) and destination
   CPE(CPE2) in the dataplane(see Section 5.2 of
   [I-D.draft-dmk-rtgwg-multisegment-sdwan]).  To accomplish that, CPE
   needs to know their peers' corresponding GW addresses.  This document
   proposes an control plane enhancement based on
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-sdwan-edge-discovery] to exchange the
   corresponding GW address between CPEs.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Corresponding GW Sub-TLV

   Corresponding GW Sub-TLV within the Hybrid Underlay Tunnel UPDATE
   indicates the address of the corresponding GW.  The following is the
   structure of the Corresponding GW Sub-TLV:

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Type=TBD2 (C-GW  subTLV)     |  Length (2 Octets)            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Corresponding GW Addr Family  | Address                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ (variable)                    +
      ~                                                               ~
      |             Corresponding GW Address                          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
