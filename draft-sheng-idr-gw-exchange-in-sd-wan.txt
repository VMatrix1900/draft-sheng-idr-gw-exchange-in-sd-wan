1.  Introduction

   [I-D.draft-dmk-rtgwg-multisegment-sdwan] describes how enterprises
   leverage Cloud Providers’ backbone infrastructure to interconnect
   their branch offices.  As illustrated in Figure 1, CPE-1 and CPE-2
   establish connections to their respective Cloud Gateways (GW) in
   distinct regions.  CPE-1 and CPE-2 maintain the pairwise IPsec
   Security Associations (SAs).  The IPsec encrypted traffic from CPE-1
   to CPE-2 is encapsulated by the GENEVE header [RFC8926], with the
   outer destination address being the GW1.

   [I-D.draft-dmk-rtgwg-multisegment-sdwan] specifies a set of sub-TLVs
   to convey information about the GWs associated with the destination
   branches, such as GW3 for CPE-2, along with additional attributes.
   To accomplish this, CPE-1 must be aware of the associated GW
   addresses of their peers.  This document proposes a BGP extension
   based on [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-sdwan-edge-discovery], enabling a CPE to
   advertise its directly connected GW address to other CPEs.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following acronyms and terms are used in this document:

   *  Cloud DC: Off-Premises Data Center, managed by 3rd party, that
      hosts applications, services, and workload for different
      organizations or tenants.

   *  CPE: Customer (Edge) Premises Equipment.

   *  OnPrem: On Premises data centers and branch offices.

   *  RR Route Reflector.

   *  SD-WAN: Software Defined Wide Area Network.  In this document,
      “SD-WAN” refers to a policy-driven transporting of IP packets over
      multiple underlay networks for better WAN bandwidth management,
      visibility, and control.

   *  VPN Virtual Private Network.

3.  Extension to SD-WAN Underlay UPDATE for Associated GWs

   The Client Routes Update is the same as described in Section 5 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-sdwan-edge-discovery].

3.1.  NLRI SD-WAN SAFI Route Type For GW

   Adding a new attribute (Associated-Gateway Sub-TLV) to the SD-WAN-
   Hybrid Tunnel Encoding which is included in the SD-WAN SAFI (=74)
   Underlay Tunnel Update:

   +------------------+
   |    Route Type    | 2 octet
   +------------------+
   |     Length       | 2 Octet
   +------------------+
   |   Type Specific  |
   ~ Value (Variable) ~
   |                  |
   +------------------+

   NLRI Route-Type = 2: For advertising the detailed properties of the
   transit gateways for the edge.  The SD-WAN NLRI Route-Type =2 has the
   following encoding:

   +------------------+
   |  Route Type = 2  | 2 octet
   +------------------+
   |     Length       | 2 Octet
   +------------------+
   |   SD-WAN Color   | 4 octets
   +------------------+
   |  SD-WAN-Node-ID  | 4 or 16 octets
   +------------------+

   SD-WAN-Color: To represent a group of tunnels that correlate with the
   Color-Extended-community included in a client route UPDATE.  When
   multiple SD-WAN edges can reach a client route co-located at one
   site, the SD-WAN- Color can represent a group of tunnels terminated
   at those SD-WAN edges co-located at the site, which effectively
   represents the site.

   SD-WAN Node ID: The node's IPv4 or IPv6 address.

3.2.  Associated GW Sub-TLV

   The Associated GW Sub-TLV, within the SD-WAN-Hybrid Tunnel TLV (code
   point 25), carries the associated GW address(es) with which the SD-
   WAN edge is associated.

   The following is the structure of the Associated GW Sub-TLV:

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |               Type=TBD    |    length     |  Priority         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Associated GW Addr Family     | Address                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ (variable)                    +
      ~                                                               ~
      |             Associated GW Address                             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Priority (1-255) indicate the preference of the GW.  The higher the
   value, the more preference is the GW.

   Priority = 0 represents that the connection exists but request Cloud
   Backbone not to choose the GW if possible.

4.  Manageability Considerations

   Effective management of SD-WAN edge nodes and the exchange of
   associated cloud gateway information are critical aspects in ensuring
   a robust and scalable SD-WAN deployment.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Need IANA to assign a new Sub-TLV Type under the SD-WAN-Hybrid Tunnel
   TLV.

   *  SD-WAN Associated GW Sub-TLV.
